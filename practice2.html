                You reel me out then you cut the string

                How come I end up where I went wrong?
                Won't take my eyes off the ball again
                First you reel me out and then you cut the string
                You used to be alright
                What happened?
                Did the cat get your tongue?
                Did your string come undone?
                One by one
                One by one
                It comes to us all
                It's as soft as your pillow
                You used to be alright
                What happened?
                Et cetera, et cetera
                Fads for whatever
                15 steps, then a sheer drop
                How come I end up where I started?
                How come I end up where I went wrong?
                Won't take my eyes off the ball again
                You reel me out then you cut the string
            </p>
